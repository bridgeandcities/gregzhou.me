<blockquote>
<p><strong>New World, Victoria Park — Online sales agent</strong><br />
October 2018 - present</p>

<p>The role requires communicating directly with customers and working with staff members of other departments. I trained a new staff member in April 2019 and successfully integrated them into daily operations. Delivering orders requires good time management skills and the ability to work well under pressure by organising deliveries and ensuring on time order fulfilment. My contribution to the department has allowed us to retain our position as the best performing online department out of all the New World stores in New Zealand.</p>

<p><strong>Overload 2017 — Volunteer</strong><br />
30th September 2017</p>

<p>I was a part of the team that set up the venue, performed ticketing duties during the exhibition and was in charge of clean up duties at the end of the event.</p>

<p><strong>Kumon, Remuera — Tutor</strong><br />
April 2016 - July 2016</p>

<p>I promoted individual learning by teaching  and helping students develop a personal study plan to achieve academic success. The role also included communicating with the student’s caregiver about their progress to help achieve set goals.</p>
